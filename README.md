## Passive Features

Features that are always enabled and don't have a switch.

* ### Mount Hunger

   When riding a mount that has health your hunger bar will be still visible instead of the vanilla behavior which hides it completely. Also your experience bar will remain visible unless you jump with a horse.

* ### Bee Hive/Nest Info

   Adds a bee count and honey level to Bee Hives & Nests tooltip (ADVANCED TOOLTIPS has to be enabled!).

## Toggleable Features

List of all toggleable features. Configuration is in in-game options menu called 'FVT...'. Keybindings are configured in the usual Controls menu (FVT category) and are by default unset. There is a keybind for opening the menu aswell.

* ### FVT Button Position

   The most useful part of this mod. Adds the option to change the 'FVT...' button position in settings menu.

* ### Toggle Feature Chat Messages

   If enabled sends a chat message (only visible to you) whenever you enable/disable a feature using assigned key.

* ### Chat History Length

   Allows you to change the amount of messages you can scroll up in chat.

* ### HUD Info

   Shows your location, pitch, cardinal direction and block light while ingame.

* ### Hotbar Autohide

   Automatically hides your hotbar when not in use (meaning not switching items or optionally using/picking/droping them). The amount of time it takes to hide is also adjustable.

   Has two independent modes:

   **1) Full**

   The entire hotbar (including health, armor, hunger etc.) will be automatically hidden.

   **2) Partial**

   Only hotbar itself will be hidden.

* ### Disable 'W' To Sprint

   The header says it all. Gets rid of one of the most annoying features.

* ### Chat Death Coordinates

   Sends your last death coordinates in chat after you respawn (only visible to you).

* ### Tool Breaking

   Has two independent modes:

   **1) Warning**

   When your tools go below 10% durability and have 12 or less uses a red warning text appears on your screen for two seconds. Can be either on top of the screen or above the hotbar. Text size can be changed in settings.

   **2) Prevent breaking**

   Makes your tools stop working at certain durability (will stop at 2 durability for most tools). This includes swords, pickaxes, axes, shovels, hoes, trident, bow and crossbow. Can be overriden (by default holding right ALT).

* ### No Break Swap Stop

   Will no longer stop breaking a block when you swap tools.

* ### Cloud Height

   Allows you to set the height at which clouds render (-64 to 320).

* ### No Block Breaking Particles

   Disables the particles that spawn when you break a block.

* ### No Potion Particles

   Disables the particles that spawn when you have a potion effect on yourself, you know, those view obstructing ones.

* ### No Vignette

   Disables the black vignette around HUD. Especially noticeable in darker areas.

* ### No Spyglass Overlay

   Disables spyglass overlay while zooming in.

* ### Damage Tilt

   Let's you disable or tune down the screen tilt when you take damage.

* ### Attack Through

   Let's you attack entities through collisionless blocks such as grass and flowers without destroying them first.

* ### Refill Hand

   Once the stack in your main hand is below 50% automatically finds the same item in your inventory and restocks it.

* ### AutoTotem

   Upon totem activation will automatically find another totem in your inventory and replace the one that was just consumed. Does not matter if you hold the totem in your main hand or offhand, works in both.

* ### AutoElytra

   If you have a chestplate on and an elytra in your inventory will automatically swap them when flying/landing. NOTE: will pick the items from the upper-left corner first so if you have multiple chestplates the one closer to that corner will be picked first.

* ### FastTrade

   If you hold shift while clicking on a villager trade it will automatically perform the trade. Basically shift-clicks the output slot for you, therefore saving you a click.

* ### Use Delay

   By default while you hold the use key (usually RMB) the game will perform the use action every 4 ticks. This options let's you set it from 1 tick delay to 20 tick delay (ex. at 1 will place as fast as it can and at 20 will place roughly once every second).

* ### Creative Break Delay

   By default while you hold the attack key (usually LMB) in creative to break blocks the game will perform the attack every 6 ticks. This let's you change the delay from 1 tick to 10 ticks. Setting this to 1 will make it break as fast as it can.

* ### Container Buttons

   Chests, barrels and shulker boxes have three buttons that let you deposit all into the container, yoink all from the container or yeet it all out on the ground. If you hold CTRL while clicking either the take or deposit button it will only move matching items, meaning only those that are present in the inventory you move the items to.

* ### Inventory Button

   Adds a drop button to every screen with your inventory (crafting, dropper, horse... screen) that will drop your inventory on the ground (only your inventory, not every slot on the screen!).

* ### Horse Stats

   Horses, donkeys and mules have a "Stats" button which upon hover shows it's health, speed and jump height.

* ### Offhand AutoEat (keybindable)

   Will automatically eat the food in your offhand as soon as you loose enough hunger for it to be fully utilized, will also eat if your health is low.

* ### Invisible Offhand (keybindable)

   Makes your offhand completely invisible but will still remain fully functional.

* ### Random Block Placement (keybindable)

   Randomly selects a block from your hotbar to place every time you try to place a block or when you have an empty hand.

* ### Placement Lock (keybindable)

   Forces placement to a single plane or axis when placing blocks by holding the use key (usually RMB). Very useful for making platforms and pillars. Basically the locking is determined from the first three placed blocks, meaning if you place three blocks in an 'L' shape it will lock the placement to the plane the 'L' sits in, if you place the three blocks in a straight line the placement will be locked to that line.

* ### Spyglass Zoom (keybindable)

   You no longer need to have spyglass in you hand to use it, all it takes now is to have it anywhere in your inventory and then press a key to activate.

* ### Fullbright (keybindable)

   Self-explanatory. Useful for caving and in Nether.

* ### Entity Outline (keybindable)

   Makes all entities (except players) glow white and be seen through walls. Useful for mob spawn proofing.

* ### Freelook (keybindable)

   Allows you to rotate the camera in third person without rotating the player itself (by default holding left ALT).

* ### Freecam (keybindable)

   Allows you to leave your body and explore your surroundings. Works similar to spectator mode.

* ### Trigger AutoAttack (keybindable)

   Automatically attacks living beings (not players) if you place your crosshair over them and in reach. Primarily meant for AFK farms.
